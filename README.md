Instructions:
=============


First off you have to export your skins as an apk and then place that apk in the assets folder of your project.

Then in the uccw.java file replace "your.package.name" with your main projects package name

and replace "your skins.apk" with the name of your skins apk. 

For the uccw.xml you can add any image you'd like, just place it in the res/drawable folder.
